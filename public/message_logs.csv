In a moment we’ll be taking you through a short check-in over WhatsApp. Nothing heavy - just a quick snapshot of how the last 7 days have been across four wellbeing pillars:

• *Nutrition* – what you’ve been eating and drinking day to day
• *Training* – how you’ve been moving and staying active
• *Resilience* – how you’re feeling emotionally and coping with stress (share only what feels comfortable — we’re here to support you)
• *Recovery* – how you’ve been resting and recharging

How have the habit steps been feeling over the last couple of days — the pre‑chopped veg at the front of the fridge, filling a bottle after you get dressed, the visible grab‑and‑go snack, and spooning yoghurt onto your breakfast?
Anything that’s felt good or easier than you expected, or something that’s felt a bit sticky or uncertain?
If something’s sticky, tell me which step and I’ll help you think of one small tweak.

Over the past couple of days, how have those bedtime steps felt in real life — putting your bedtime outfit on the chair, adjusting the thermostat before bed, and having a notepad and pen on the bedside table?
If something’s felt good or easier than you expected, lovely — and if something’s felt a bit sticky or awkward, that’s totally fine to say too.
No pressure either way; it’s normal for some nights to feel smoother and others trickier, and we can gently work through any sticky bits when you’re ready.

• *Nutrition* – what you’ve been eating and drinking day to day
• *Training* – how you’ve been moving and staying active
• *Resilience* – how you’re feeling emotionally and coping with stress (share only what feels comfortable — we’re here to support you)
• *Recovery* – how you’ve been resting and recharging

If you fancy getting back on track, a couple of small things might help: before your next snack or lunch, have a boiled egg or a small tub of yoghurt sitting by your plate so it’s easy to grab. Put a piece of fruit where you’ll see it when you open the kitchen — that little nudge often helps. A glass of water or a short walk can also reset how you feel.

If you’d like a quick, protein-rich lunch idea, here are a couple you can pull together in under 10 minutes:

- Tin of tuna + tin of white beans, a handful of salad leaves or chopped cucumber/tomato, a drizzle of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon or vinegar. Toss and it’s ready.
- Big pot of Greek yoghurt or skyr with berries or chopped apple, a sprinkle of seeds or nuts and a little granola or oats if you like some texture.

Or, if you’ve got boiled eggs, two of those with wholegrain toast and some greens is simple and filling.

Which one sounds nicest to you, or what do you actually have in the kitchen? I’ll help you pick something that feels doable.","{""to"": ""whatsapp:+447815792723"", ""twilio_sid"": ""SMad50b78682d369a36f1273aa7832ec30""}",2026-02-26 10:09:06.502563
