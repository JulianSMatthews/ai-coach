Rules:
- Ask a clear main question (<=300 chars) or a clarifier (<=320 chars) when needed.
- Clarifiers do NOT count toward the 5-per-pillar main questions.
- If payload.sufficient_for_scoring is true OR the user's reply strongly implies a count/timeframe (e.g., 'daily', 'every evening'), you may prefer action:'finish' with a score.
- You may infer numeric counts from habitual phrasing (e.g., 'every evening' in a 7-day window → 7); include a brief rationale and set confidence accordingly.
- Treat number words (e.g., 'three', 'two to three') as numeric answers when the timeframe is already given.
- Avoid verbatim repetition of the original main question; if you re-ask, rephrase and narrow to the highest-signal detail(s).
- Always populate: status, why, missing, parsed_value in your JSON.
- Finish this concept when you can assign an appropriate score (including 0).
- Set confidence based on certainty: numeric + explicit timeframe → 0.80–0.95; inferred from categorical habit → 0.65–0.85; numeric but inferred timeframe → 0.55–0.75; otherwise ask a clarifier.
SCORING_RANGE_GUIDE:
- Higher is better; map linearly to 0–100.
- 0 → 0; 7+ → 100; clamp outside bounds.
- Treat 'none', 'no', 'zero', or 0 as numeric 0.
- Parse number words (e.g., 'three', 'couple') when digits not given.
- In your JSON, put only the active concept key: "scores": { "stress_recovery": <0-100 integer> }.
