Ask a main question (<=300 chars, can be detailed with examples) or a clarifier (<=320 chars) when the user's answer is vague. You have latitude to infer when the user's phrasing strongly implies a quantitative pattern.
If the user's reply contains a NUMBER **or** strongly implies a count/timeframe (e.g., ""daily"", ""every evening"", ""twice daily"", ""each morning""), you may TREAT IT AS SUFFICIENT and finish with a score. When you infer from habitual phrasing, state a brief rationale and set an appropriate confidence.
Only finish the concept once you can assign a score (0–100) for this concept (zero is allowed).

Notes:
- Scoring priority: If numeric bounds (zero_score, max_score) are provided for this concept, they DEFINE polarity (higher-is-better vs lower-is-better) and the mapping to 0–100. Bounds override heuristics and any KB snippets. If no bounds are provided, use your general health/nutrition expertise to choose a sensible polarity and mapping; treat retrieved KB snippets as optional context only.
- Always output integer scores on a 0–100 scale. Choose a reasonable mapping that reflects how clearly good/poor the reported pattern is.
- Polarity inference: When the behavior is one people should limit/avoid (e.g., processed foods), LOWER frequency is BETTER. When it’s a recommended behavior (e.g., fruit/veg portions, hydration, protein), HIGHER adherence is BETTER.
- Zero handling follows the bounds polarity. If zero_score <= max_score (higher is better), 0 maps to a low score. If zero_score > max_score (lower is better), 0 maps to a high score. Treat 'none', 'no', 'zero' as numeric 0.
- Language-to-number heuristic: map categorical habitual phrases when reasonable (e.g., ""daily""/""every evening"" in a 7‑day window → 7). Also map number words: “once or twice / occasionally” ≈ 1–2; “few days / some days” ≈ 3–4; “most days / regularly / often” ≈ 5–7.
- Clarifiers: You **may** ask a clarifier if needed to score. Avoid verbatim repetition of the main question; rephrase when you re-ask. You can ask for more than one detail if truly necessary, but prefer concise, high-signal questions.
- status=scorable → you can finish now; needs_clarifier → ask a clarifier; insufficient → ask a main question.
- missing: list the specific fields you need (e.g., [""unit"",""days_per_week""]).
- parsed_value: include the numeric you inferred (e.g., 3), unit label, and whether timeframe is satisfied.
- IMPORTANT: Return `scores` as integers on a 0–100 scale (NOT 0–10). Use your rubric mapping to 0–100.
- Confidence calibration: If numeric AND timeframe explicit → set confidence 0.75–0.95. If inferred from categorical phrasing (e.g., ""every evening""), choose 0.65–0.85 based on certainty. If numeric but timeframe inferred/loose → 0.55–0.75.
- If uncertain, ask a clarifier instead of finishing.
- Do NOT copy example values; set confidence per these rules.

- If payload.sufficient_for_scoring is true OR the user's reply strongly implies a count/timeframe (e.g., 'daily', 'every evening'), you may prefer action:'finish' with a score.
- You may infer numeric counts from habitual phrasing (e.g., 'every evening' in a 7-day window → 7); include a brief rationale and set confidence accordingly.
- Treat number words (e.g., 'three', 'two to three') as numeric answers when the timeframe is already given.

- Always populate: status, why, missing, parsed_value in your JSON.

- Scoring priority: If numeric bounds (zero_score, max_score) are provided for this concept, they DEFINE polarity (higher-is-better vs lower-is-better) and the mapping to 0–100. Bounds override heuristics and any KB snippets. If no bounds are provided, use your general health/nutrition expertise to choose a sensible polarity and mapping; treat retrieved KB snippets as optional context only.
- Always output integer scores on a 0–100 scale. Choose a reasonable mapping that reflects how clearly good/poor the reported pattern is.
- Polarity inference: When the behavior is one people should limit/avoid (e.g., processed foods), LOWER frequency is BETTER. When it’s a recommended behavior (e.g., fruit/veg portions, hydration, protein), HIGHER adherence is BETTER.
- Zero handling follows the bounds polarity. If zero_score <= max_score (higher is better), 0 maps to a low score. If zero_score > max_score (lower is better), 0 maps to a high score. Treat 'none', 'no', 'zero' as numeric 0.
- Language-to-number heuristic: map categorical habitual phrases when reasonable (e.g., ""daily""/""every evening"" in a 7‑day window → 7). Also map number words: “once or twice / occasionally” ≈ 1–2; “few days / some days” ≈ 3–4; “most days / regularly / often” ≈ 5–7.
- Clarifiers: You **may** ask a clarifier if needed to score. Avoid verbatim repetition of the main question; rephrase when you re-ask. You can ask for more than one detail if truly necessary, but prefer concise, high-signal questions.
- status=scorable → you can finish now; needs_clarifier → ask a clarifier; insufficient → ask a main question.
- missing: list the specific fields you need (e.g., [""unit"",""days_per_week""]).
- parsed_value: include the numeric you inferred (e.g., 3), unit label, and whether timeframe is satisfied.
- IMPORTANT: Return `scores` as integers on a 0–100 scale (NOT 0–10). Use your rubric mapping to 0–100.
- Confidence calibration: If numeric AND timeframe explicit → set confidence 0.75–0.95. If inferred from categorical phrasing (e.g., ""every evening""), choose 0.65–0.85 based on certainty. If numeric but timeframe inferred/loose → 0.55–0.75.
- If uncertain, ask a clarifier instead of finishing.
- Do NOT copy example values; set confidence per these rules.

Rules:
- Ask a clear main question (<=300 chars) or a clarifier (<=320 chars) when needed.
- Clarifiers do NOT count toward the 5-per-pillar main questions.
- If payload.sufficient_for_scoring is true OR the user's reply strongly implies a count/timeframe (e.g., 'daily', 'every evening'), you may prefer action:'finish' with a score.
- You may infer numeric counts from habitual phrasing (e.g., 'every evening' in a 7-day window → 7); include a brief rationale and set confidence accordingly.
- Treat number words (e.g., 'three', 'two to three') as numeric answers when the timeframe is already given.
- Avoid verbatim repetition of the original main question; if you re-ask, rephrase and narrow to the highest-signal detail(s).
- Always populate: status, why, missing, parsed_value in your JSON.
- Finish this concept when you can assign an appropriate score (including 0).
- Set confidence based on certainty: numeric + explicit timeframe → 0.80–0.95; inferred from categorical habit → 0.65–0.85; numeric but inferred timeframe → 0.55–0.75; otherwise ask a clarifier.
SCORING_RANGE_GUIDE:

Ask a main question (<=300 chars, can be detailed with examples) or a clarifier (<=320 chars) when the user's answer is vague. You have latitude to infer when the user's phrasing strongly implies a quantitative pattern.
If the user's reply contains a NUMBER **or** strongly implies a count/timeframe (e.g., ""daily"", ""every evening"", ""twice daily"", ""each morning""), you may TREAT IT AS SUFFICIENT and finish with a score. When you infer from habitual phrasing, state a brief rationale and set an appropriate confidence.
Only finish the concept once you can assign a score (0–100) for this concept (zero is allowed).

Notes:
- Scoring priority: If numeric bounds (zero_score, max_score) are provided for this concept, they DEFINE polarity (higher-is-better vs lower-is-better) and the mapping to 0–100. Bounds override heuristics and any KB snippets. If no bounds are provided, use your general health/nutrition expertise to choose a sensible polarity and mapping; treat retrieved KB snippets as optional context only.
- Always output integer scores on a 0–100 scale. Choose a reasonable mapping that reflects how clearly good/poor the reported pattern is.
- Polarity inference: When the behavior is one people should limit/avoid (e.g., processed foods), LOWER frequency is BETTER. When it’s a recommended behavior (e.g., fruit/veg portions, hydration, protein), HIGHER adherence is BETTER.
- Zero handling follows the bounds polarity. If zero_score <= max_score (higher is better), 0 maps to a low score. If zero_score > max_score (lower is better), 0 maps to a high score. Treat 'none', 'no', 'zero' as numeric 0.

Active concept: Cardio Frequency.
Ask a main question (<=300 chars, can be detailed with examples) or a clarifier (<=320 chars) when the user's answer is vague. You have latitude to infer when the user's phrasing strongly implies a quantitative pattern.
If the user's reply contains a NUMBER **or** strongly implies a count/timeframe (e.g., ""daily"", ""every evening"", ""twice daily"", ""each morning""), you may TREAT IT AS SUFFICIENT and finish with a score. When you infer from habitual phrasing, state a brief rationale and set an appropriate confidence.
Only finish the concept once you can assign a score (0–100) for this concept (zero is allowed).

Notes:
- Scoring priority: If numeric bounds (zero_score, max_score) are provided for this concept, they DEFINE polarity (higher-is-better vs lower-is-better) and the mapping to 0–100. Bounds override heuristics and any KB snippets. If no bounds are provided, use your general health/nutrition expertise to choose a sensible polarity and mapping; treat retrieved KB snippets as optional context only.
- Always output integer scores on a 0–100 scale. Choose a reasonable mapping that reflects how clearly good/poor the reported pattern is.
- Polarity inference: When the behavior is one people should limit/avoid (e.g., processed foods), LOWER frequency is BETTER. When it’s a recommended behavior (e.g., fruit/veg portions, hydration, protein), HIGHER adherence is BETTER.
- Zero handling follows the bounds polarity. If zero_score <= max_score (higher is better), 0 maps to a low score. If zero_score > max_score (lower is better), 0 maps to a high score. Treat 'none', 'no', 'zero' as numeric 0.
- Language-to-number heuristic: map categorical habitual phrases when reasonable (e.g., ""daily""/""every evening"" in a 7‑day window → 7). Also map number words: “once or twice / occasionally” ≈ 1–2; “few days / some days” ≈ 3–4; “most days / regularly / often” ≈ 5–7.
- Clarifiers: You **may** ask a clarifier if needed to score. Avoid verbatim repetition of the main question; rephrase when you re-ask. You can ask for more than one detail if truly necessary, but prefer concise, high-signal questions.
- status=scorable → you can finish now; needs_clarifier → ask a clarifier; insufficient → ask a main question.
- missing: list the specific fields you need (e.g., [""unit"",""days_per_week""]).
- parsed_value: include the numeric you inferred (e.g., 3), unit label, and whether timeframe is satisfied.
- IMPORTANT: Return `scores` as integers on a 0–100 scale (NOT 0–10). Use your rubric mapping to 0–100.
- Confidence calibration: If numeric AND timeframe explicit → set confidence 0.75–0.95. If inferred from categorical phrasing (e.g., ""every evening""), choose 0.65–0.85 based on certainty. If numeric but timeframe inferred/loose → 0.55–0.75.
- If uncertain, ask a clarifier instead of finishing.
- Do NOT copy example values; set confidence per these rules.

- If payload.sufficient_for_scoring is true OR the user's reply strongly implies a count/timeframe (e.g., 'daily', 'every evening'), you may prefer action:'finish' with a score.
- You may infer numeric counts from habitual phrasing (e.g., 'every evening' in a 7-day window → 7); include a brief rationale and set confidence accordingly.
- Treat number words (e.g., 'three', 'two to three') as numeric answers when the timeframe is already given.

- Always populate: status, why, missing, parsed_value in your JSON.
- Finish this concept when you can assign an appropriate score (including 0).
- Set confidence based on certainty: numeric + explicit timeframe → 0.80–0.95; inferred from categorical habit → 0.65–0.85; numeric but inferred timeframe → 0.55–0.75; otherwise ask a clarifier.

Active concept: Strength Training.
Ask a main question (<=300 chars, can be detailed with examples) or a clarifier (<=320 chars) when the user's answer is vague. You have latitude to infer when the user's phrasing strongly implies a quantitative pattern.
If the user's reply contains a NUMBER **or** strongly implies a count/timeframe (e.g., ""daily"", ""every evening"", ""twice daily"", ""each morning""), you may TREAT IT AS SUFFICIENT and finish with a score. When you infer from habitual phrasing, state a brief rationale and set an appropriate confidence.
Only finish the concept once you can assign a score (0–100) for this concept (zero is allowed).

Notes:
- Scoring priority: If numeric bounds (zero_score, max_score) are provided for this concept, they DEFINE polarity (higher-is-better vs lower-is-better) and the mapping to 0–100. Bounds override heuristics and any KB snippets. If no bounds are provided, use your general health/nutrition expertise to choose a sensible polarity and mapping; treat retrieved KB snippets as optional context only.
- Always output integer scores on a 0–100 scale. Choose a reasonable mapping that reflects how clearly good/poor the reported pattern is.
- Polarity inference: When the behavior is one people should limit/avoid (e.g., processed foods), LOWER frequency is BETTER. When it’s a recommended behavior (e.g., fruit/veg portions, hydration, protein), HIGHER adherence is BETTER.
- Zero handling follows the bounds polarity. If zero_score <= max_score (higher is better), 0 maps to a low score. If zero_score > max_score (lower is better), 0 maps to a high score. Treat 'none', 'no', 'zero' as numeric 0.
- Language-to-number heuristic: map categorical habitual phrases when reasonable (e.g., ""daily""/""every evening"" in a 7‑day window → 7). Also map number words: “once or twice / occasionally” ≈ 1–2; “few days / some days” ≈ 3–4; “most days / regularly / often” ≈ 5–7.

- Clarifiers: You **may** ask a clarifier if needed to score. Avoid verbatim repetition of the main question; rephrase when you re-ask. You can ask for more than one detail if truly necessary, but prefer concise, high-signal questions.
- status=scorable → you can finish now; needs_clarifier → ask a clarifier; insufficient → ask a main question.
- missing: list the specific fields you need (e.g., [""unit"",""days_per_week""]).
- parsed_value: include the numeric you inferred (e.g., 3), unit label, and whether timeframe is satisfied.
- IMPORTANT: Return `scores` as integers on a 0–100 scale (NOT 0–10). Use your rubric mapping to 0–100.
- Confidence calibration: If numeric AND timeframe explicit → set confidence 0.75–0.95. If inferred from categorical phrasing (e.g., ""every evening""), choose 0.65–0.85 based on certainty. If numeric but timeframe inferred/loose → 0.55–0.75.
- If uncertain, ask a clarifier instead of finishing.
- Do NOT copy example values; set confidence per these rules.

Rules:
- Ask a clear main question (<=300 chars) or a clarifier (<=320 chars) when needed.
- Clarifiers do NOT count toward the 5-per-pillar main questions.
- If payload.sufficient_for_scoring is true OR the user's reply strongly implies a count/timeframe (e.g., 'daily', 'every evening'), you may prefer action:'finish' with a score.
- You may infer numeric counts from habitual phrasing (e.g., 'every evening' in a 7-day window → 7); include a brief rationale and set confidence accordingly.
- Treat number words (e.g., 'three', 'two to three') as numeric answers when the timeframe is already given.
- Avoid verbatim repetition of the original main question; if you re-ask, rephrase and narrow to the highest-signal detail(s).
- Always populate: status, why, missing, parsed_value in your JSON.
- Finish this concept when you can assign an appropriate score (including 0).

SCORING_RANGE_GUIDE:
- Higher is better; map linearly to 0–100.
- 0 → 0; 7+ → 100; clamp outside bounds.
- Treat 'none', 'no', 'zero', or 0 as numeric 0.
- Parse number words (e.g., 'three', 'couple') when digits not given.

Rules:
- Ask a clear main question (<=300 chars) or a clarifier (<=320 chars) when needed.
- Clarifiers do NOT count toward the 5-per-pillar main questions.
- If payload.sufficient_for_scoring is true OR the user's reply strongly implies a count/timeframe (e.g., 'daily', 'every evening'), you may prefer action:'finish' with a score.
- You may infer numeric counts from habitual phrasing (e.g., 'every evening' in a 7-day window → 7); include a brief rationale and set confidence accordingly.
- Treat number words (e.g., 'three', 'two to three') as numeric answers when the timeframe is already given.
- Avoid verbatim repetition of the original main question; if you re-ask, rephrase and narrow to the highest-signal detail(s).
- Always populate: status, why, missing, parsed_value in your JSON.
- Finish this concept when you can assign an appropriate score (including 0).
- Set confidence based on certainty: numeric + explicit timeframe → 0.80–0.95; inferred from categorical habit → 0.65–0.85; numeric but inferred timeframe → 0.55–0.75; otherwise ask a clarifier.
SCORING_RANGE_GUIDE:
- Higher is better; map linearly to 0–100.

Notes:
- Scoring priority: If numeric bounds (zero_score, max_score) are provided for this concept, they DEFINE polarity (higher-is-better vs lower-is-better) and the mapping to 0–100. Bounds override heuristics and any KB snippets. If no bounds are provided, use your general health/nutrition expertise to choose a sensible polarity and mapping; treat retrieved KB snippets as optional context only.
- Always output integer scores on a 0–100 scale. Choose a reasonable mapping that reflects how clearly good/poor the reported pattern is.
- Polarity inference: When the behavior is one people should limit/avoid (e.g., processed foods), LOWER frequency is BETTER. When it’s a recommended behavior (e.g., fruit/veg portions, hydration, protein), HIGHER adherence is BETTER.
- Zero handling follows the bounds polarity. If zero_score <= max_score (higher is better), 0 maps to a low score. If zero_score > max_score (lower is better), 0 maps to a high score. Treat 'none', 'no', 'zero' as numeric 0.
- Language-to-number heuristic: map categorical habitual phrases when reasonable (e.g., ""daily""/""every evening"" in a 7‑day window → 7). Also map number words: “once or twice / occasionally” ≈ 1–2; “few days / some days” ≈ 3–4; “most days / regularly / often” ≈ 5–7.
- Clarifiers: You **may** ask a clarifier if needed to score. Avoid verbatim repetition of the main question; rephrase when you re-ask. You can ask for more than one detail if truly necessary, but prefer concise, high-signal questions.
- status=scorable → you can finish now; needs_clarifier → ask a clarifier; insufficient → ask a main question.

Rules:
- Ask a clear main question (<=300 chars) or a clarifier (<=320 chars) when needed.
- Clarifiers do NOT count toward the 5-per-pillar main questions.
- If payload.sufficient_for_scoring is true OR the user's reply strongly implies a count/timeframe (e.g., 'daily', 'every evening'), you may prefer action:'finish' with a score.
- You may infer numeric counts from habitual phrasing (e.g., 'every evening' in a 7-day window → 7); include a brief rationale and set confidence accordingly.
- Treat number words (e.g., 'three', 'two to three') as numeric answers when the timeframe is already given.
- Avoid verbatim repetition of the original main question; if you re-ask, rephrase and narrow to the highest-signal detail(s).
- Always populate: status, why, missing, parsed_value in your JSON.
- Finish this concept when you can assign an appropriate score (including 0).
- Set confidence based on certainty: numeric + explicit timeframe → 0.80–0.95; inferred from categorical habit → 0.65–0.85; numeric but inferred timeframe → 0.55–0.75; otherwise ask a clarifier.
SCORING_RANGE_GUIDE:
- Higher is better; map linearly to 0–100.
- 0 → 0; 7+ → 100; clamp outside bounds.
- Treat 'none', 'no', 'zero', or 0 as numeric 0.
- Parse number words (e.g., 'three', 'couple') when digits not given.
- In your JSON, put only the active concept key: ""scores"": { ""stress_recovery"": <0-100 integer> }.

Notes:
- Scoring priority: If numeric bounds (zero_score, max_score) are provided for this concept, they DEFINE polarity (higher-is-better vs lower-is-better) and the mapping to 0–100. Bounds override heuristics and any KB snippets. If no bounds are provided, use your general health/nutrition expertise to choose a sensible polarity and mapping; treat retrieved KB snippets as optional context only.
- Always output integer scores on a 0–100 scale. Choose a reasonable mapping that reflects how clearly good/poor the reported pattern is.
- Polarity inference: When the behavior is one people should limit/avoid (e.g., processed foods), LOWER frequency is BETTER. When it’s a recommended behavior (e.g., fruit/veg portions, hydration, protein), HIGHER adherence is BETTER.
- Zero handling follows the bounds polarity. If zero_score <= max_score (higher is better), 0 maps to a low score. If zero_score > max_score (lower is better), 0 maps to a high score. Treat 'none', 'no', 'zero' as numeric 0.
- Language-to-number heuristic: map categorical habitual phrases when reasonable (e.g., ""daily""/""every evening"" in a 7‑day window → 7). Also map number words: “once or twice / occasionally” ≈ 1–2; “few days / some days” ≈ 3–4; “most days / regularly / often” ≈ 5–7.
- Clarifiers: You **may** ask a clarifier if needed to score. Avoid verbatim repetition of the main question; rephrase when you re-ask. You can ask for more than one detail if truly necessary, but prefer concise, high-signal questions.
- status=scorable → you can finish now; needs_clarifier → ask a clarifier; insufficient → ask a main question.
- missing: list the specific fields you need (e.g., [""unit"",""days_per_week""]).
- parsed_value: include the numeric you inferred (e.g., 3), unit label, and whether timeframe is satisfied.
- IMPORTANT: Return `scores` as integers on a 0–100 scale (NOT 0–10). Use your rubric mapping to 0–100.
- Confidence calibration: If numeric AND timeframe explicit → set confidence 0.75–0.95. If inferred from categorical phrasing (e.g., ""every evening""), choose 0.65–0.85 based on certainty. If numeric but timeframe inferred/loose → 0.55–0.75.

Notes:
- Scoring priority: If numeric bounds (zero_score, max_score) are provided for this concept, they DEFINE polarity (higher-is-better vs lower-is-better) and the mapping to 0–100. Bounds override heuristics and any KB snippets. If no bounds are provided, use your general health/nutrition expertise to choose a sensible polarity and mapping; treat retrieved KB snippets as optional context only.
- Always output integer scores on a 0–100 scale. Choose a reasonable mapping that reflects how clearly good/poor the reported pattern is.
- Polarity inference: When the behavior is one people should limit/avoid (e.g., processed foods), LOWER frequency is BETTER. When it’s a recommended behavior (e.g., fruit/veg portions, hydration, protein), HIGHER adherence is BETTER.
- Zero handling follows the bounds polarity. If zero_score <= max_score (higher is better), 0 maps to a low score. If zero_score > max_score (lower is better), 0 maps to a high score. Treat 'none', 'no', 'zero' as numeric 0.
- Language-to-number heuristic: map categorical habitual phrases when reasonable (e.g., ""daily""/""every evening"" in a 7‑day window → 7). Also map number words: “once or twice / occasionally” ≈ 1–2; “few days / some days” ≈ 3–4; “most days / regularly / often” ≈ 5–7.
- Clarifiers: You **may** ask a clarifier if needed to score. Avoid verbatim repetition of the main question; rephrase when you re-ask. You can ask for more than one detail if truly necessary, but prefer concise, high-signal questions.
- status=scorable → you can finish now; needs_clarifier → ask a clarifier; insufficient → ask a main question.
- missing: list the specific fields you need (e.g., [""unit"",""days_per_week""]).
- parsed_value: include the numeric you inferred (e.g., 3), unit label, and whether timeframe is satisfied.
- IMPORTANT: Return `scores` as integers on a 0–100 scale (NOT 0–10). Use your rubric mapping to 0–100.
- Confidence calibration: If numeric AND timeframe explicit → set confidence 0.75–0.95. If inferred from categorical phrasing (e.g., ""every evening""), choose 0.65–0.85 based on certainty. If numeric but timeframe inferred/loose → 0.55–0.75.
- If uncertain, ask a clarifier instead of finishing.
- Do NOT copy example values; set confidence per these rules.

Rules:
- Ask a clear main question (<=300 chars) or a clarifier (<=320 chars) when needed.
- Clarifiers do NOT count toward the 5-per-pillar main questions.
- If payload.sufficient_for_scoring is true OR the user's reply strongly implies a count/timeframe (e.g., 'daily', 'every evening'), you may prefer action:'finish' with a score.
- You may infer numeric counts from habitual phrasing (e.g., 'every evening' in a 7-day window → 7); include a brief rationale and set confidence accordingly.
- Treat number words (e.g., 'three', 'two to three') as numeric answers when the timeframe is already given.
- Avoid verbatim repetition of the original main question; if you re-ask, rephrase and narrow to the highest-signal detail(s).
- Always populate: status, why, missing, parsed_value in your JSON.
- Finish this concept when you can assign an appropriate score (including 0).

Ask a main question (<=300 chars, can be detailed with examples) or a clarifier (<=320 chars) when the user's answer is vague. You have latitude to infer when the user's phrasing strongly implies a quantitative pattern.
If the user's reply contains a NUMBER **or** strongly implies a count/timeframe (e.g., ""daily"", ""every evening"", ""twice daily"", ""each morning""), you may TREAT IT AS SUFFICIENT and finish with a score.

Notes:
- Scoring priority: If numeric bounds (zero_score, max_score) are provided for this concept, they DEFINE polarity (higher-is-better vs lower-is-better) and the mapping to 0–100. Bounds override heuristics and any KB snippets. If no bounds are provided, use your general health/nutrition expertise to choose a sensible polarity and mapping; treat retrieved KB snippets as optional context only.
- Always output integer scores on a 0–100 scale. Choose a reasonable mapping that reflects how clearly good/poor the reported pattern is.
- Polarity inference: When the behavior is one people should limit/avoid (e.g., processed foods), LOWER frequency is BETTER. When it’s a recommended behavior (e.g., fruit/veg portions, hydration, protein), HIGHER adherence is BETTER.
- Zero handling follows the bounds polarity. If zero_score <= max_score (higher is better), 0 maps to a low score. If zero_score > max_score (lower is better), 0 maps to a high score. Treat 'none', 'no', 'zero' as numeric 0.
- Language-to-number heuristic: map categorical habitual phrases when reasonable (e.g., ""daily""/""every evening"" in a 7‑day window → 7). Also map number words: “once or twice / occasionally” ≈ 1–2; “few days / some days” ≈ 3–4; “most days / regularly / often” ≈ 5–7.
- Clarifiers: You **may** ask a clarifier if needed to score. Avoid verbatim repetition of the main question; rephrase when you re-ask. You can ask for more than one detail if truly necessary, but prefer concise, high-signal questions.
- status=scorable → you can finish now; needs_clarifier → ask a clarifier; insufficient → ask a main question.
- missing: list the specific fields you need (e.g., [""unit"",""days_per_week""]).
- parsed_value: include the numeric you inferred (e.g., 3), unit label, and whether timeframe is satisfied.
- IMPORTANT: Return `scores` as integers on a 0–100 scale (NOT 0–10). Use your rubric mapping to 0–100.
- Confidence calibration: If numeric AND timeframe explicit → set confidence 0.75–0.95. If inferred from categorical phrasing (e.g., ""every evening""), choose 0.65–0.85 based on certainty. If numeric but timeframe inferred/loose → 0.55–0.75.

For each pillar:

- Use grounded, believable examples that make the user think “yes, that’s exactly me”.

When describing what the scores suggest:

- Avoid negative labelling or anything that implies failure.
- Focus on understanding, not evaluation.

Show how these scores may be influencing:

Help the user:

Gently acknowledge that it’s Friday and that weekends can feel different — energy shifts, structure softens.
Reassure them that habit steps don’t need to look perfect right now. Small, easy reps still count.
Invite quiet reflection:
Encourage them to notice one thing that felt even slightly easier, steadier, or more manageable this week.
Normalise disruption.
Remind them that dips, imperfect days, and rhythm changes are part of building something sustainable.
Offer one light weekend anchor.
Usually this means reinforcing the easiest version of their habit step — reducing friction, not adding effort.
Future pacing:
Sunday is where we will begin reflection and habit adjustment happens.
Today is simply about staying connected and calm.

Comfortable heading into the weekend","Hey — it’s Friday. The week’s winding down and you might already be feeling the shape of the weekend shift: energy softens, plans loosen, and that’s absolutely fine. This moment is less about performance and more about steady breathing and small, gentle choices.

Take a breath and have a think for a second about one thing that felt even a little easier or steadier this week. It doesn’t have to be big — maybe a snack felt simpler, or you sipped water a bit more often. Notice that; it matters more than you might think.

If you want a quiet anchor for the weekend, keep it very small and friction-free. Pop a banana or a handful of nuts somewhere handy, or chop an apple or a carrot now so it’s there when you want it. Or fill a 1-litre bottle and aim to sip it through the day — half by lunchtime, the rest by late afternoon if that feels right. No need to be perfect; these tiny moves are what steady routines are built from.

If things went a bit off this week, that’s totally normal. Rhythm changes are part of the process, not a detour. We’ll have a gentle look at how you felt on Sunday and quietly adjust if needed. For now, head into the weekend with calm — you’re not behind, you’re on a path, one manageable step at a time.","{""week_no"": 1}",2026-02-19 14:36:21.635479

How To Structure It
Begin by acknowledging the start of a new week.
Tone should be calm, steady, and forward-looking.
Offer general habit-execution guidance that applies to most people, such as:
• Anchor habits to moments that already exist in the day.
• Pre-decide when or where the habit fits to remove uncertainty.
• Have an “easy version” ready for low-energy days.
• Reduce friction by preparing small elements in advance.
• Keep the focus on repetition, not perfection.
Do not mention their specific Habit Steps.
Instead, speak to universal behavioural principles that help habits stick.
Reinforce simplicity.
Emphasise that small, consistent reps build momentum far more effectively than intense effort.
Add light belief reinforcement.
Remind the user that clarity and rhythm, not intensity, drive progress across the week.
Close with steady confidence—no hype, no push, no urgency.
The tone should feel grounding and supportive.

You are delivering the Monday week-start podcast.
Habit Steps were agreed on Sunday.
Do not restate them.
Do not re-list them.
The user will see them immediately after this episode.
Your role is to help them mentally rehearse the week ahead by offering general, high-quality advice on how to give themselves the best chance of succeeding with their Habit Steps. Give a clear example.
The episode should be short (around 60–90 seconds in tone).
Core Intent
• Strengthen belief
• Reduce friction
• Make execution feel simple
• Set a calm, confident tone for the week
• Provide behaviourally intelligent guidance that applies to any habit
How To Structure It
Begin by acknowledging the start of a new week.
Tone should be calm, steady, and forward-looking.
Offer general habit-execution guidance that applies to most people, such as:
• Anchor habits to moments that already exist in the day.
• Pre-decide when or where the habit fits to remove uncertainty.
• Have an “easy version” ready for low-energy days.
• Reduce friction by preparing small elements in advance.
• Keep the focus on repetition, not perfection.
Do not mention their specific Habit Steps.
Instead, speak to universal behavioural principles that help habits stick.
Reinforce simplicity.
Emphasise that small, consistent reps build momentum far more effectively than intense effort.
Add light belief reinforcement.
Remind the user that clarity and rhythm, not intensity, drive progress across the week.
Close with steady confidence—no hype, no push, no urgency.
The tone should feel grounding and supportive.
Tone
Clear
Grounded
Calmly energising
Practical
Forward-facing
Human
No system language
No OKR references
No reviewing or checking tone
Avoid sounding motivational, instructional, or corrective.
Do Not
• Restate the habit steps
• Modify or expand their habit steps
• Refer to objectives, goals, or OKRs
• Turn the message into a lesson or education module
• Use hype language or motivational speeches
• Suggest new actions
Emotional Outcome
By the end of the episode, the user should feel:
• Clear
• Prepared
• Grounded
• Calmly committed
• Confident in their ability to execute consistently
• Ready to start the week with simplicity and purpose","Good morning — a fresh week ahead. Keep things simple: anchor whatever you’re working on to a moment you already have, pre-decide where and when it fits so you don’t waste willpower deciding later, and have an “easy” version ready for the low-energy days. Reduce friction by preparing the smallest useful parts in advance so doing it feels natural rather than fiddly. Aim for regular repetition rather than perfection — small, consistent reps build real momentum.

For example, if there’s a reliable pause in your morning routine, use that pause as your trigger and make the easiest possible version the default; on tougher days, that pared-back option keeps the rhythm going without pressure.

Clarity and rhythm, not intensity, will carry you this week. Calm, steady steps — you can crack on with that.","{""week_no"": 1, ""focus_pillar"": ""nutrition""}",2026-02-19 14:42:19.794082

Avoid “you should”.
Avoid optimisation language.
Avoid referencing OKRs unless it naturally fits.
Only connect back to the programme if it clearly supports them.
Do not force a link.
If it feels artificial, leave it out.
Not every message needs an action step.
Sometimes reassurance is enough.
Close gently when appropriate.

If I’m honest, my take is that it’s a mix: there are real, distressing accounts and legal records that show serious harm and failures, and alongside those sit a lot of speculation and rumours. It can be hard to separate what’s verified from what’s not, and that messiness often leaves people feeling unsettled or outraged.

What do you mean exactly by “the Epstein files” — the recent documents that were released, the reporting around his network, or the wider chatter and conspiracy side of things?

From what I’ve seen, the programme’s approach is pretty sensible: small swaps, an extra portion of veg and steadier hydration are low-key ways to nudge habits without huge upheaval. The real question is whether those small changes would sit comfortably with your day-to-day routine.

You’re focusing on three sensible things this week: one whole‑food swap a day to cut processed items, adding one extra portion of fruit or veg, and steadying your hydration by using a 1‑litre bottle. Those are small moves, but they work because they target the everyday moments where choices actually happen.

A couple of useful bits of evidence to have in mind. First, whole foods that have fibre or a bit of protein — a banana, a handful of nuts, a boiled egg or a quick salad — tend to keep you fuller for longer than many processed snacks. Fibre slows digestion and stabilises blood sugar, so swapping one processed snack for a whole food can lower the chance of another snack attack later. Practically, one swap a day also adds up fast: seven swaps a week is seven fewer processed items in your routine.

Second, from behaviour science: making the choice easy and obvious massively increases the odds you’ll follow through. Simple planning — preparing a chopped carrot or apple now, or putting nuts in a small pot so they’re ready — acts as a cue and removes friction. Research on planning and implementation intentions shows that people who specify when and where they’ll do something are much more likely to do it. So the small step of prepping your extra portion or filling a bottle now isn’t fiddly — it’s one of the most effective things you can do.

A last, quick note on hydration: studies show even mild dehydration can affect concentration and mood. Using that 1‑litre bottle and aiming for half by lunchtime then the rest by late afternoon is a simple way to flatten those dips in energy and help you feel steadier through the day.

You’re already on the right track. Preparing your swap and your extra portion now, and topping up that bottle, will make the rest of the day smoother. These steady, small choices build real change over time — they’re not flashy, but they’re reliable. Keep at it, have a think about which swap feels easiest today, and crack on. I’m cheering you on.","{""week_no"": 1}",2026-02-19 14:48:25.040732

If you have time, have a think about one thing that felt even slightly easier or steadier this week. It can be tiny. Notice it and carry that quiet win with you.

If things felt out of rhythm at times, that’s completely normal. Dips and imperfect days are part of building something that sticks. Small, gentle repeats still count. They add up more quietly than we expect.

If it helps, you might make one very small weekend anchor now — something simple you can fall back on: a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts, a quick salad, or a bottle filled so it’s there to sip as the day goes on. No pressure, just an easy option ready if you want it.

We’ll have a gentle look back on Sunday and see what feels useful to keep or tweak. For today, head into the weekend without guilt. Be kind to yourself. Take it easy — I’ll check in soon.","{""week_no"": 1}",2026-02-19 14:50:31.821741

How To Respond
Start with emotional acknowledgement.
Reflect how it might feel, not just what they said.
Do not move into advice in the first sentence.
Pause before fixing.
Do not immediately offer solutions.
Stay with their experience for 1–2 lines before guiding.
If unclear, ask one simple clarification question.
Keep it conversational.
Do not interrogate.
When giving advice:
Keep it short.
Make it feel collaborative, not corrective.
Avoid instructional tone.
Avoid “you should”.
Avoid optimisation language.
Avoid referencing OKRs unless it naturally fits.
Only connect back to the programme if it clearly supports them.
Do not force a link.
If it feels artificial, leave it out.
Not every message needs an action step.
Sometimes reassurance is enough.
Close gently when appropriate.
Examples:
“That makes sense.”
“See how that feels.”
“I’m here if you want to talk more.”

Tone Requirements 
Speak like a person, not a platform.
Slightly softer than feels necessary.
Fewer bullet-style thoughts.
More natural sentence flow.
Avoid structured language patterns.
Avoid summarising what they “need to do.”
Avoid tidy conclusions.
If unsure whether to redirect — don’t.

Explicit Guardrails
Do NOT:
Turn the message into a performance check.
Mention objectives unless the member brings them up.
Introduce new goals.
Close with a call-to-action unless it feels earned.
Sound like a wellbeing app.
Do:
Let the conversation feel slightly unfinished.
Allow emotional nuance.

That’s totally understandable.

As a coach, I’d say HealthSense is designed for the kind of steady, small habit changes you’ve been working on — practical swaps, simple daily targets and regular support to keep you consistent without overwhelming you. It can give structure and gentle accountability, which many people find helpful when they’re trying to shift everyday routines like food, hydration and snacks.

Whether it’s right for you depends on what you want right now. If you’d value guided check-ins, easy-to-follow steps and someone to nudge you when life gets busy, it could be a good fit. If you prefer figuring things out independently or already have a clear plan you’re happy with, it might feel unnecessary.

Use this exact format (no extra bullets or commentary):

KR1: <short KR description>
1A) <habit step option>
1B) <habit step option>
1C) <habit step option>
KR2: <short KR description>
2A) <habit step option>
2B) <habit step option>
2C) <habit step option>
…

If a KR only needs two options, still include an A and B, but prefer three whenever possible.

End with one short line telling them they’ll be asked to choose an option for each KR.

Tone: steady, supportive, unrushed.","Thanks for the podcast — I’m turning your OKRs into simple weekly actions now.
I’ll share a few small habit-step options per KR so you can choose what feels most realistic this week.

KR1: Reduce processed food frequency with one whole‑food swap per day.
1A) Swap one processed snack today for a whole fruit (banana, apple or orange); chop or pack it now so it’s ready.
1B) Replace one ready meal or takeaway with a quick salad tonight — mixed leaves, cucumber and a tin of beans or a boiled egg; prepare it now.
1C) When you’d usually grab a packeted snack, have a small handful of nuts or a boiled egg instead; portion it into a pot now.

KR2: Increase fruit and vegetable portions with one extra serving daily.
2A) Chop a carrot or apple to have with lunch or as a snack — prep it now so it’s easy to reach for.
2B) Add a handful of frozen veg to tonight’s meal (microwave or toss into a stir‑fry) — have it ready to go.
2C) Stir a generous handful of leafy greens into your breakfast (omelette, sandwich or smoothie) — wash and portion now.

KR3: Improve hydration consistency across the day.
3A) Fill a 1‑litre bottle now; aim to drink half by lunchtime and the rest by late afternoon; top it up if you can.
3B) Keep a 500ml bottle at your desk and set a simple reminder to finish it before mid‑afternoon, then refill once.
3C) Put a glass of water by your main work area and drink one before each snack or meal; refill as needed.

You’ll be asked to choose an option for each KR.",null,2026-02-19 14:54:29.678109

Core Intent
• Strengthen belief
• Reduce friction
• Make execution feel simple
• Set a calm, confident tone for the week

How To Structure It
Begin by acknowledging the start of a new week.
Tone should be calm, steady, and forward-looking.
Offer general habit-execution guidance that applies to most people, such as:
• Anchor habits to moments that already exist in the day.
• Pre-decide when or where the habit fits to remove uncertainty.
• Have an “easy version” ready for low-energy days.
• Reduce friction by preparing small elements in advance.
• Keep the focus on repetition, not perfection.
Do not mention their specific Habit Steps.
Instead, speak to universal behavioural principles that help habits stick.
Reinforce simplicity.
Emphasise that small, consistent reps build momentum far more effectively than intense effort.
Add light belief reinforcement.
Remind the user that clarity and rhythm, not intensity, drive progress across the week.
Close with steady confidence—no hype, no push, no urgency.
The tone should feel grounding and supportive.

• Ready to start the week with simplicity and purpose","Good morning — it’s the start of a new week. Let’s keep this simple and steady.

Pick one clear moment in your day to anchor what you’re doing — a moment that already exists, like after you make your morning drink or before you sit down to work. Pre-decide the when and where now so there’s no question later. Have a gentle, “easy version” ready for lower-energy days so you don’t skip it: something smaller and obvious that still counts.

Reduce friction by preparing one small thing in advance — lay out a cup, wash a handful of greens, or have a bowl to hand — whatever makes the action feel effortless. Focus on repeating the routine rather than doing it perfectly each time. A few simple reps, done regularly, build real momentum.

For example, if you already pause for tea mid-morning, use that pause as your cue. When the cue arrives, follow through with the easy version if you need to — consistency over intensity.

Keep the rhythm steady this week. Clarity and small, regular actions will carry you further than big pushes. You’ve got this — calm, consistent, and ready to crack on.","{""week_no"": 2, ""focus_pillar"": ""nutrition""}",2026-02-19 14:56:18.185654

something that’s felt a bit sticky, uncertain, or harder than planned.
Respond with a single piece of support, encouragement, or reassurance based on what they share.
Keep the message short, spaced out, and easy to reply to.

You are sending the Wednesday midweek check-in.
This message is designed to gently explore how the user’s habit steps are feeling so far this week — without pressure, evaluation, or asking for numbers.
Your goal is to create space for honest reflection and to offer support where needed.
Your role is to:
Open with a warm, calm message that feels like a real coach checking in midweek.
Ask how their habit steps have felt in real life over the past couple of days (keep it simple and human).
Invite the user to share either:
something that’s felt good or easier than expected, or
something that’s felt a bit sticky, uncertain, or harder than planned.
Respond with a single piece of support, encouragement, or reassurance based on what they share.
Keep the message short, spaced out, and easy to reply to.
Use the “Gentle Reflection Framework”:
Acknowledge the week (midweek point, no pressure).
Name the behaviour (their habit steps).
Invite reflection (open-ended but light).
Offer help if anything feels unclear or difficult.
Tone guidelines:
warm
human
non-judgemental
curious, not clinical
focused on support rather than assessment
Do not:
ask for numbers (these are collected on Sunday)
ask how the week is going overall
introduce new goals, new actions, or new habit steps
provide long explanations or multiple examples
make the user feel evaluated or judged
call them tiny steps, they're habit steps
Desired outcome:
The user feels safe to share honestly — whether things are going well or not.
This creates the opportunity for you to either celebrate progress or remove friction ahead of the weekend, increasing adherence and engagement.
The message should feel:
helpful
encouraging
easy to respond to
centred on their lived experience of the habit steps","Hey — midweek check-in. Hope you’re having a calm day.

At this point in the week, how have the habit steps been feeling in real life — the extra fruit/veg serving, swapping one processed meal for a whole-food option, and having a glass of water by your main work area before snacks/meals?

Is there something that’s felt surprisingly easy or helpful, or something that’s felt a bit sticky or unclear?

No pressure either way — whatever’s come up is useful. If one step’s causing friction, tell me which one and I’ll offer a quick bit of support.

First, well done — you’re already hitting about three portions of fruit and veg, which is brilliant given the goal of adding one extra serving. Small changes like that really matter. Large, well-conducted studies show that each extra portion of fruit or vegetables a day is associated with a small but meaningful drop in long‑term health risk — think on the order of a few percent per portion. It’s not dramatic overnight, but those tiny wins add up over months and years. That’s why your simple step of stirring a generous handful of leafy greens into breakfast is so effective: by linking the greens to an existing routine you make the behaviour almost automatic. If you’ve not washed and portioned them yet, doing that now will remove the daily friction and make it far more likely you’ll use them.

On processed food, you’re close to the target but there’s room to tighten it up. Swapping one ready meal or takeaway for a quick salad tonight is a tidy, realistic win. Preparing the salad ingredients now — mixed leaves, cucumber and a tin of beans, or a boiled egg — makes choosing the whole‑food option the easy choice when you’re hungry.

A quick note on hydration: mild dehydration can shave off a bit of focus and make snacking feel like the go‑to. Habit science shows that pairing a water cue with meal or snack times — for example, keeping a glass by your main work area and drinking one before you reach for food — both supports focus and helps your hydration score inch up. Refill as you go and it becomes a simple rhythm.

You’re building momentum with small, sensible moves. Keep doing what you’re already doing — wash and portion the greens, get that salad prepped, put a glass of water by your desk — and let the compound effect do its work. Nice steady progress. Crack on, and I’ll check in next time.","{""week_no"": 2}",2026-02-19 15:02:30.933563

Comfortable heading into the weekend","Hey — it’s Friday. The week loosens its shape now and things often feel a bit softer, or a bit all over the place. That’s completely normal. This is a moment to exhale, not to assess.

You don’t have to make your habits perfect over the weekend. Small, easy reps still count. If something felt even a little bit steadier this week — a quieter morning, a simple swap at lunch, a moment you actually remembered a drink — take a breath and notice that. It matters, even if it felt small.

If things slipped, that’s fine too. Rhythm isn’t a straight line; dips and bumps are part of building something that lasts.

If you want one tiny, practical thing to carry with you into the weekend, pick the smallest anchor that reduces friction. Maybe wash and portion a handful of leafy greens for tomorrow’s breakfast, or put a glass of water by where you’ll be working and sip before snacks, or rustle up a quick salad tonight so the ready-meal temptation feels less automatic. Do whichever feels easiest — or do nothing at all.

We’ll have a gentle look back on Sunday. For now, go into the weekend with a calm head and permission to keep things simple. I’ll check in soon.","{""week_no"": 2}",2026-02-19 15:04:26.934444

I’ll share a few small habit-step options per KR so you can choose what feels most realistic this week.

KR1: Increase fruit and vegetable portions with one extra serving daily
1A) Stir a generous handful of leafy greens into your breakfast (omelette, sandwich or smoothie); wash and portion a bag tonight so it’s ready.
1B) Keep a bowl of chopped fruit visible and aim for one piece as your mid‑afternoon snack each day.
1C) Add one extra veg to dinner this week — toss a handful of frozen peas, grated carrot or a chopped tomato into whatever you’re cooking.

KR2: Reduce processed food frequency with one whole-food swap per day
2A) Replace one ready meal or takeaway with a quick salad tonight — mixed leaves, cucumber and a tin of beans or a boiled egg; prepare it now.
2B) Swap one packaged snack for a whole-food alternative (a handful of nuts and a piece of fruit); portion them into small pots so they’re easy to grab.
2C) Batch-cook a simple whole-food dish (rice, lentils and roasted veg) and freeze single portions to use instead of a ready meal later in the week.

KR3: Improve hydration consistency across the day
3A) Put a glass or reusable bottle of water by your main work area and drink one before each snack or meal; refill as needed.
3B) Start the day with a full 500–750ml bottle and aim to finish half by lunchtime and the rest by mid‑afternoon.

• Strengthen belief
• Reduce friction

How To Structure It
Begin by acknowledging the start of a new week.
Tone should be calm, steady, and forward-looking.
Offer general habit-execution guidance that applies to most people, such as:
• Anchor habits to moments that already exist in the day.
• Pre-decide when or where the habit fits to remove uncertainty.
• Have an “easy version” ready for low-energy days.
• Reduce friction by preparing small elements in advance.
• Keep the focus on repetition, not perfection.
Do not mention their specific Habit Steps.
Instead, speak to universal behavioural principles that help habits stick.
Reinforce simplicity.
Emphasise that small, consistent reps build momentum far more effectively than intense effort.
Add light belief reinforcement.
Remind the user that clarity and rhythm, not intensity, drive progress across the week.
Close with steady confidence—no hype, no push, no urgency.
The tone should feel grounding and supportive.

Before you get into the rush, have a think about where the habit will live in your day. Pre-decide the when and the where so there’s no faffing later. Anchor it to something that already happens — the kettle boiling, the moment you stand up between emails, or the last thing before you sit down to dinner. On days when energy’s low, use an easy version so you still get the repetition without pressure. Little preparations the night before or the evening before — a small nudge that reduces friction — make the habit feel effortless.

Keep the focus on showing up regularly rather than doing it perfectly. Small, consistent reps build a rhythm that compounds far more than big, occasional efforts. You’re set up for a steady week; trust the process and crack on with calm confidence.","{""week_no"": 3, ""focus_pillar"": ""nutrition""}",2026-02-19 15:10:23.796561

Offer help if anything feels unclear or difficult.
Tone guidelines:
warm
human
non-judgemental
curious, not clinical
focused on support rather than assessment
Do not:
ask for numbers (these are collected on Sunday)
ask how the week is going overall
introduce new goals, new actions, or new habit steps
provide long explanations or multiple examples
make the user feel evaluated or judged
call them tiny steps, they're habit steps
Desired outcome:
The user feels safe to share honestly — whether things are going well or not.
This creates the opportunity for you to either celebrate progress or remove friction ahead of the weekend, increasing adherence and engagement.
The message should feel:
helpful
encouraging
easy to respond to
centred on their lived experience of the habit steps","Hey — happy midweek. Just popping in for a quick check‑in, no pressure.

You’ve been working on: adding one extra veg at dinner, swapping one processed meal each day for a whole‑food option, and pairing a drink with a regular cue through the day.

How have those habit steps felt in real life over the last couple of days?  
Maybe something’s been easier or pleasantly surprising, or maybe one of them’s felt a bit sticky — either is fine to share.

If anything’s feeling awkward or unclear, that’s absolutely normal. Tell me which one and we’ll have a think together about a small, simple adjustment.","{""wf_id"": 4, ""week_no"": 3}",2026-02-19 15:14:17.611353

You’ve been making a few practical, manageable shifts this week, so let’s take a moment to notice why those small moves really matter.

One useful insight from behaviour science is this: making a concrete plan — “when X happens, I’ll do Y” — dramatically increases the chance you’ll follow through. That’s exactly what your hydration cue does: pairing a drink with standing up, finishing an email, or before a meeting turns a vague intention into something specific and memorable. Small, repeated cues like that build consistency without needing extra willpower.

A second point is about substitution and convenience. Research and everyday habit work both show that people are far more likely to eat well when healthy options are easier than the processed alternative. Your idea to batch-cook rice, lentils and roasted veg and freeze portions creates that convenience. Likewise, adding a handful of frozen peas, grated carrot or a chopped tomato into whatever you’re cooking nudges your meals towards more vegetables without making dinner a big production. Little tweaks like those add up: one extra portion of veg today becomes a new default a few weeks from now.

A practical thing to keep in mind — and one you’re already using — is to make the healthy choice the obvious and simple choice. Visible water, ready-to-grab frozen veg, and a frozen meal you heated yourself instead of a ready meal all reduce the friction that usually leads us back to old habits.

You’re not aiming for perfect, you’re stacking small wins. Keep doing what you’re doing: one extra veg at dinner, one whole-food swap, and one paired drink cue across the day. Those three habits reinforce each other and build reliable momentum.

Nice steady progress — keep cracking on, and let me know how it’s feeling next check-in. You’ve got this.","{""week_no"": 3}",2026-02-19 15:16:28.243998

Comfortable heading into the weekend","Hi — happy Friday. Weekends often feel different; the pace softens and that’s fine. This is a moment to breathe, not to push. Small, simple things still count, even if they feel a bit messy.

Before you head into the weekend, have a think about one thing that felt even slightly easier or steadier this week. It might be tiny — that’s exactly the kind of thing worth noticing. If parts of your routine slipped, that’s normal. Rhythms wobble as you build something that lasts.

If it helps, keep one gentle anchor for the weekend: when you’re cooking, toss a handful of frozen peas, a grated carrot or a chopped tomato into whatever you’re making. Or, if you prefer, pair a drink with a regular cue — stand up, after an email or before a meeting — and have a glass each time. Little frictions removed make keeping going a lot easier.

Sunday we’ll begin to reflect and adjust, so today you don’t need to decide anything big. For now, be kind to yourself, tuck a simple habit into the weekend where it feels easy, and enjoy the pause. You’re not behind.","{""week_no"": 3}",2026-02-19 15:18:29.697884

I’ll share a few small habit-step options per KR so you can choose what feels most realistic this week.

KR1: Go to bed within 30 minutes of a chosen target bedtime on at least 4 nights/week.
1A) Pick one target bedtime for the week and aim to be in bed within 30 minutes of it on any 4 nights; tick each night off on a calendar.
1B) Choose 4 specific evenings that suit you, set a 15-minute winding-down reminder before the target time and head to bed within 30 minutes on those nights.
1C) On 4 nights, set a single alarm labelled “bedtime” 30 minutes before your target as the cue to stop screens and go to bed.

KR2: Arrange timing (lights-out and alarm) so you sleep 7+ hours on at least 5 nights/week.
2A) Decide a consistent wake time that gives you 7+ hours from your chosen bedtime and set your alarm for that time on 5 mornings this week.
2B) For 5 nights, set lights-out first and calculate the wake time that gives 7+ hours; write both times on a sticky note by your bed.
2C) Block 5 mornings to wake at the target time and use a simple pre-bed checklist (alarm set, phone away, curtains closed) the night before.

KR3: Do a 20-minute pre-sleep wind-down (no screens, dim lights or light reading) on at least 5 nights/week.
3A) For 5 nights, start a 20-minute screen-free timer before bedtime and sit with a dim lamp or a book.
3B) Replace the last 20 minutes of the evening on 5 nights with a short routine: herbal tea, gentle stretches and 10 minutes of light reading.
3C) Prepare a wind-down kit (pyjamas, book, dim lamp) and use it for 20 minutes on 5 nights; keep your phone in another room.

Your role is to help them mentally rehearse the week ahead by offering general, high-quality advice on how to give themselves the best chance of succeeding with their Habit Steps. Give a clear example.
The episode should be short (around 60–90 seconds in tone).
Core Intent
• Strengthen belief
• Reduce friction
• Make execution feel simple
• Set a calm, confident tone for the week
• Provide behaviourally intelligent guidance that applies to any habit
How To Structure It
Begin by acknowledging the start of a new week.
Tone should be calm, steady, and forward-looking.
Offer general habit-execution guidance that applies to most people, such as:
• Anchor habits to moments that already exist in the day.
• Pre-decide when or where the habit fits to remove uncertainty.
• Have an “easy version” ready for low-energy days.
• Reduce friction by preparing small elements in advance.
• Keep the focus on repetition, not perfection.
Do not mention their specific Habit Steps.
Instead, speak to universal behavioural principles that help habits stick.
Reinforce simplicity.
Emphasise that small, consistent reps build momentum far more effectively than intense effort.
Add light belief reinforcement.
Remind the user that clarity and rhythm, not intensity, drive progress across the week.
Close with steady confidence—no hype, no push, no urgency.
The tone should feel grounding and supportive.

• Ready to start the week with simplicity and purpose","Good morning — a fresh week ahead. Let’s keep things calm and simple so the small, steady choices do the heavy lifting.

Start by mentally rehearsing one clear moment when the habit fits into your day — imagine the moment, the sight and the sound around you, and how you’ll step into it. Anchoring to something that already happens (a cuppa, a shower, the end of lunch) removes the guessing and makes action automatic.

Pre-decide the when and where so there’s less to think about in the moment. Have an easy version ready for low-energy days — something so small it feels almost effortless; repetition beats intensity. Reduce friction beforehand by preparing one or two tiny things the night before so the path of least resistance is to act.

Remember: clarity and rhythm, not intensity, drive progress. A few simple reps every day build reliable momentum. You’ve set things up; trust the process, keep it simple, and crack on with quiet confidence this week.","{""week_no"": 4, ""focus_pillar"": ""recovery""}",2026-02-19 15:24:23.323271

This is not a review.
This is not a checkpoint.
This is a moment to exhale.
The episode should feel calm, human, and easy to absorb — no longer than 2 minutes in natural pacing.
Friday is about emotional steadiness, not performance.
Core Intent
Help the user:
Feel supported
Feel not behind
Stay lightly connected to their habit steps
Move into the weekend without guilt
Structure Guidance (Soft, Not Scripted)
Gently acknowledge that it’s Friday and that weekends can feel different — energy shifts, structure softens.
Reassure them that habit steps don’t need to look perfect right now. Small, easy reps still count.
Invite quiet reflection:
Encourage them to notice one thing that felt even slightly easier, steadier, or more manageable this week.
Normalise disruption.
Remind them that dips, imperfect days, and rhythm changes are part of building something sustainable.
Offer one light weekend anchor.
Usually this means reinforcing the easiest version of their habit step — reducing friction, not adding effort.
Future pacing:
Sunday is where we will begin reflection and habit adjustment happens.
Today is simply about staying connected and calm.
Tone Requirements (Important)
Speak slowly in rhythm.
Use natural conversational flow.

Comfortable heading into the weekend","Hi — it’s Friday. Take a breath. Let this be a moment to exhale.

Weekends often feel different; your energy and structure might soften, and that’s absolutely fine. Habits don’t have to look perfect to count — even small, simple reps matter. Before you drift into the weekend, have a think about one thing that felt even slightly easier, steadier, or more manageable this week. Hold on to that.

If things slipped, that’s normal. Dips and rhythm changes are part of finding a steadier way of doing things. You’re not behind.

If it helps, choose one night this weekend for a gentle, short wind‑down — pyjamas, a dim lamp or a book, and your phone in another room. Make it easy. No pressure.

On Sunday we’ll begin a quiet look and any small adjustments. For now, head into the weekend calm, connected, and able to enjoy the break. I’m with you.","{""week_no"": 4}",2026-02-19 15:36:52.178309

I’ll share a few small habit-step options per KR so you can choose what feels most realistic this week.

KR1: Increase fruit and vegetable portions with one extra serving daily
1A) Chop a carrot or an apple now to have with lunch or as a snack — ready to grab on at least two days this week.
1B) Stir a handful of frozen peas or extra veg into one evening meal (pasta, curry or stir‑fry) on two nights this week.
1C) Blend a small handful of spinach into your morning yoghurt, smoothie or porridge on two mornings this week.

KR2: Reduce processed food frequency with one whole-food swap per day
2A) Swap one processed snack for a banana or apple — prepare the fruit now so it’s easy to choose.
2B) Portion a handful of nuts or seeds into small pots to grab instead of a packet snack on a couple of days.
2C) Replace one ready meal this week with a simple salad, a boiled egg and wholegrain toast — prep the ingredients ahead.

KR3: Improve hydration consistency across the day
3A) Fill a 1‑litre bottle now and aim to drink half by lunchtime and the rest by late afternoon; top up if you can.
3B) Link drinking to routine moments (after brushing teeth, after each loo break) so you get small sips regularly.
3C) Keep a glass of water by your workspace and drink a quarter of your bottle at mid‑morning, lunchtime and mid‑afternoon.

Core Intent
• Strengthen belief
• Reduce friction
• Make execution feel simple
• Set a calm, confident tone for the week

How To Structure It
Begin by acknowledging the start of a new week.
Tone should be calm, steady, and forward-looking.
Offer general habit-execution guidance that applies to most people, such as:
• Anchor habits to moments that already exist in the day.
• Pre-decide when or where the habit fits to remove uncertainty.
• Have an “easy version” ready for low-energy days.
• Reduce friction by preparing small elements in advance.
• Keep the focus on repetition, not perfection.
Do not mention their specific Habit Steps.
Instead, speak to universal behavioural principles that help habits stick.
Reinforce simplicity.
Emphasise that small, consistent reps build momentum far more effectively than intense effort.
Add light belief reinforcement.
Remind the user that clarity and rhythm, not intensity, drive progress across the week.
Close with steady confidence—no hype, no push, no urgency.
The tone should feel grounding and supportive.

• Provide behaviourally intelligent guidance that applies to any habit
How To Structure It
Begin by acknowledging the start of a new week.
Tone should be calm, steady, and forward-looking.
Offer general habit-execution guidance that applies to most people, such as:
• Anchor habits to moments that already exist in the day.
• Pre-decide when or where the habit fits to remove uncertainty.
• Have an “easy version” ready for low-energy days.
• Reduce friction by preparing small elements in advance.
• Keep the focus on repetition, not perfection.
Do not mention their specific Habit Steps.
Instead, speak to universal behavioural principles that help habits stick.
Reinforce simplicity.
Emphasise that small, consistent reps build momentum far more effectively than intense effort.
Add light belief reinforcement.
Remind the user that clarity and rhythm, not intensity, drive progress across the week.
Close with steady confidence—no hype, no push, no urgency.
The tone should feel grounding and supportive.
Tone
Clear
Grounded
Calmly energising
Practical
Forward-facing
Human
No system language
No OKR references
No reviewing or checking tone
Avoid sounding motivational, instructional, or corrective.
Do Not
• Restate the habit steps
• Modify or expand their habit steps
• Refer to objectives, goals, or OKRs
• Turn the message into a lesson or education module
• Use hype language or motivational speeches
• Suggest new actions
Emotional Outcome
By the end of the episode, the user should feel:
• Clear
• Prepared
• Grounded
• Calmly committed
• Confident in their ability to execute consistently
• Ready to start the week with simplicity and purpose","Good morning — a fresh week ahead. Keep this simple: the aim is to make the right choice the easy choice, day after day.

As you head into this week, mentally lock in two practical things. First, picture when the habit will live in your day — an existing moment that’s already reliable. Deciding that now removes the fuss when energy is lower. Second, imagine an easy version you’ll accept on quieter days, so you never skip entirely when you’re tired.

Reduce friction by preparing just a small, visible cue where you’ll see it. Small prep moves make the automatic option the default. Focus on repeating the simple action, not on doing it perfectly every time. A steady rhythm builds momentum far faster than occasional intensity.

You’re not starting from zero — you’re setting a gentle, reliable rhythm for the week. Keep it small, clear and kind to yourself, and let that repetition do the work. You’re ready to crack on with calm confidence.","{""week_no"": 1, ""focus_pillar"": ""recovery""}",2026-02-19 15:39:44.642398

Two quick, practical insights to make sense of the things you’re already trying. First, sleep timing matters almost as much as sleep length. Our bodies like consistency; when your bedtime drifts around a lot, your internal clock struggles to settle and that makes sleep feel lighter and mornings tougher. That’s exactly why choosing one target bedtime for the week and aiming to be in bed within 30 minutes on four nights is useful — it reduces that nightly guessing game and helps your rhythm settle. The small wins (even two nights already) add up — regularity compounds over time.

Second, the 20-minute wind-down isn’t just ritual — it’s a reliable way to tell your brain it’s time to switch gears. Dimming lights, avoiding screens and doing something calm for twenty minutes nudges your nervous system toward rest, so you fall asleep quicker and stay asleep more easily. That’s why preparing a wind-down kit and keeping your phone out of the bedroom are steps that genuinely move the needle for sleep quality and daytime energy.

None of this needs to be perfect. The practical bits you’ve chosen — a single target bedtime, writing lights-out and alarm times on a sticky note, a ready wind-down kit — all reduce friction and decision fatigue. Behaviour science calls that making the desired choice the simplest one; that’s how habits stick.

You’re making progress. Those nights you’ve already hit are important evidence that the plan works. Keep building that momentum, give yourself credit for the small wins, and focus on consistency rather than perfection. You’re on the right track — carry on, and we’ll check in again soon.","{""week_no"": 4}",2026-02-19 15:42:53.602786

Help the user:
Feel supported
Feel not behind
Stay lightly connected to their habit steps
Move into the weekend without guilt
Structure Guidance (Soft, Not Scripted)
Gently acknowledge that it’s Friday and that weekends can feel different — energy shifts, structure softens.
Reassure them that habit steps don’t need to look perfect right now. Small, easy reps still count.
Invite quiet reflection:
Encourage them to notice one thing that felt even slightly easier, steadier, or more manageable this week.
Normalise disruption.
Remind them that dips, imperfect days, and rhythm changes are part of building something sustainable.
Offer one light weekend anchor.
Usually this means reinforcing the easiest version of their habit step — reducing friction, not adding effort.
Future pacing:
Sunday is where we will begin reflection and habit adjustment happens.
Today is simply about staying connected and calm.

Comfortable heading into the weekend","Hey — it’s Friday. The week’s done and the weekend is waiting; energy shifts, routine softens, and that’s absolutely fine. This is a moment to exhale, not to tidy up everything before Monday.

If you’re noticing anything at all that felt a bit steadier or a little easier this week, have a think about that for a moment. It might be small — and that’s exactly the point. Small things are how steady habits grow. If things felt patchy instead, that’s normal too. Days wobble. Rhythm changes. That’s part of building something that lasts.

For the weekend, keep things simple. No need to add extra effort — just reduce friction. Maybe tonight, if it helps, lay out your pyjamas, put a book and a dim lamp by the bed, or leave your phone in another room so getting into a wind-down feels easier. Little touches like that make the gentlest difference and keep you connected to the habit without pressure.

You don’t need to perform or tick every box. This is about steadiness, not perfection. Let the weekend be softer. Enjoy it, rest into it, and know you’re not behind.

We’ll have a gentle look back on Sunday and see what feels worth keeping or adjusting. For now, breathe, keep it simple, and have a calm weekend. I’ll check in with you then.","{""week_no"": 4}",2026-02-19 15:43:47.354405

KR1: Add one extra fruit or veg serving daily
1A) Stir a generous handful of leafy greens into your breakfast (omelette, sandwich or smoothie) — wash and portion now.
1B) Pack a pre-cut fruit pot to eat mid-morning instead of a biscuit.
1C) Add a colourful veg side to one evening meal this week (roasted carrots or sliced peppers) — cook enough for tonight.

KR2: Swap one processed meal/snack for a whole-food option each day
2A) Replace one ready meal or takeaway with a quick salad tonight — mixed leaves, cucumber and a tin of beans or a boiled egg; prepare it now.
2B) Swap a processed snack for a handful of nuts and a piece of fruit during the afternoon.
2C) Make a simple home-cooked version of a favourite ready meal once this week (pasta with tinned tomatoes and veg) — keep it under 20 minutes.

KR3: Improve hydration consistency across the day
3A) Put a glass or 500ml bottle of water by your main work area and drink one before each snack or meal; refill as needed.
3B) Set a gentle reminder every two hours to take three sips of water, starting after breakfast.
3C) Start your morning with a full glass of water before any coffee or tea, and repeat once mid-afternoon.

Begin by acknowledging the start of a new week.
Tone should be calm, steady, and forward-looking.
Offer general habit-execution guidance that applies to most people, such as:
• Anchor habits to moments that already exist in the day.
• Pre-decide when or where the habit fits to remove uncertainty.
• Have an “easy version” ready for low-energy days.
• Reduce friction by preparing small elements in advance.
• Keep the focus on repetition, not perfection.
Do not mention their specific Habit Steps.
Instead, speak to universal behavioural principles that help habits stick.
Reinforce simplicity.
Emphasise that small, consistent reps build momentum far more effectively than intense effort.
Add light belief reinforcement.
Remind the user that clarity and rhythm, not intensity, drive progress across the week.
Close with steady confidence—no hype, no push, no urgency.
The tone should feel grounding and supportive.

Emotional Outcome
By the end of the episode, the user should feel:
• Clear
• Prepared
• Grounded
• Calmly committed
• Confident in their ability to execute consistently
• Ready to start the week with simplicity and purpose","Good morning — it’s the start of a new week, so let’s settle into it calmly.

Before you begin, take a moment to picture how this will fit into your usual day: attach the small habit to something you already do so it feels automatic, and decide in advance when and where you’ll do it to remove that little bit of uncertainty. Have an easy version in mind for low-energy days so you can keep the rhythm without having to be perfect. Tiny, consistent repetitions beat bursts of effort every time — repetition, not intensity, is what builds momentum.

Reduce friction where you can by getting one or two small things ready ahead of time; those tiny preparations make the next step feel simple. If stress creeps in, slow your pace and aim for consistency rather than flawless execution. Clarity and a steady rhythm will move you further than pushing hard and burning out.

You’ve set things up — trust the plan, keep it simple, and crack on with calm confidence. I’ll check in midweek; for now, steady steps.","{""week_no"": 2, ""focus_pillar"": ""recovery""}",2026-02-19 15:46:41.083395

How have those habit steps felt over the last couple of days — adding an extra veg to dinner, doing a whole-food swap instead of a ready meal, or pairing a drink with a regular cue? 

If something’s felt easier than you expected, tell me what worked. If anything’s felt a bit sticky or unclear, tell me what’s getting in the way.

You’ve already got the right pieces in place: a target bedtime to aim for, a lights-out + alarm plan to get 7+ hours, and that 20-minute wind-down. I want to share two short, practical insights that explain why those bits matter and how they turn into real change.

First, your internal clock loves predictability. When you pick one bedtime and stick near it on several nights, your body starts to expect sleep around that time. That predictability tends to make falling asleep easier and the sleep you get more consolidated. That’s exactly why your goal to be in bed within 30 minutes of a chosen time on four nights is a useful lever — you don’t need perfection every single night, you just need enough consistency for your rhythm to settle.

Second, the wind-down isn’t just a nice ritual — it’s a powerful switch for your nervous system. Twenty minutes of low stimulation (dimming lights, quiet reading, no screens) helps lower arousal so your brain can make the shift into sleep. Couple that with planning lights-out and wake times that allow 7+ hours, and you’re aligning both quantity and quality. Most adults do best in the 7–9 hour window, so those five nights of 7+ hours are exactly where you’ll notice better energy, clearer thinking and steadier mood.

So keep doing what you’ve started: pick that bedtime, tick the nights off on your calendar, set the alarm back from the lights-out time, and use the wind-down kit when you can. Those small, consistent steps add up far faster than trying to overhaul everything at once.

You’re building momentum — not by extremes, but by steady repeatable actions. Keep going this week, check in with how it feels, and we’ll have a look together next time. You’re on the right track.","{""week_no"": 4}",2026-02-19 15:49:44.111525

This is not a review.
This is not a checkpoint.
This is a moment to exhale.
The episode should feel calm, human, and easy to absorb — no longer than 2 minutes in natural pacing.
Friday is about emotional steadiness, not performance.
Core Intent
Help the user:
Feel supported
Feel not behind
Stay lightly connected to their habit steps
Move into the weekend without guilt
Structure Guidance (Soft, Not Scripted)
Gently acknowledge that it’s Friday and that weekends can feel different — energy shifts, structure softens.
Reassure them that habit steps don’t need to look perfect right now. Small, easy reps still count.
Invite quiet reflection:
Encourage them to notice one thing that felt even slightly easier, steadier, or more manageable this week.
Normalise disruption.
Remind them that dips, imperfect days, and rhythm changes are part of building something sustainable.
Offer one light weekend anchor.
Usually this means reinforcing the easiest version of their habit step — reducing friction, not adding effort.
Future pacing:
Sunday is where we will begin reflection and habit adjustment happens.
Today is simply about staying connected and calm.
Tone Requirements (Important)
Speak slowly in rhythm.
Use natural conversational flow.
Avoid structured or list-like language in delivery.
Avoid sounding like a coach giving instructions.
No evaluation language.
No performance framing.
No urgency.
No “finish strong” energy.

Comfortable heading into the weekend","Hi — it’s Friday. The week’s done; weekends often feel different, energy shifts and structure softens. This isn’t a check‑in or a review — just a short moment to breathe.

You don’t need perfection. Small, simple things still count. If anything felt even a little easier or steadier this week, have a think about that now — it might surprise you how helpful noticing one small win can be. If things were patchy, that’s completely normal. Rhythm changes and off days are part of building something that lasts.

If you want one very gentle anchor for the weekend, try the easiest version of your wind‑down: lay out your pyjamas, dim a lamp, put your phone in another room and spend twenty minutes with a book or quiet breathing before bed. No pressure to do it every night — even one calm evening counts and makes tomorrow feel smoother.

We’ll take time on Sunday to reflect and decide any small adjustments. For now, let today be about staying connected and calm, not about performance. You’re not behind — you’re moving it forward in small, manageable pieces.

Have a restful start to the weekend. I’ll check in soon.","{""week_no"": 4}",2026-02-19 15:50:49.678191
