In a moment we’ll be taking you through a short check-in over WhatsApp. Nothing heavy - just a quick snapshot of how the last 7 days have been across four wellbeing pillars:

• *Nutrition* – what you’ve been eating and drinking day to day
• *Training* – how you’ve been moving and staying active
• *Resilience* – how you’re feeling emotionally and coping with stress (share only what feels comfortable — we’re here to support you)
• *Recovery* – how you’ve been resting and recharging

These questions help us build a clear picture of your routine so we can tailor the next steps that actually matter for you.","{""to"": ""whatsapp:+447860362908"", ""twilio_sid"": ""SM25a75ab1cfd1eacf354b0d8467594988""}",2026-02-23 10:23:31.013711

In a moment we’ll be taking you through a short check-in over WhatsApp. Nothing heavy - just a quick snapshot of how the last 7 days have been across four wellbeing pillars:

• *Nutrition* – what you’ve been eating and drinking day to day
• *Training* – how you’ve been moving and staying active
• *Resilience* – how you’re feeling emotionally and coping with stress (share only what feels comfortable — we’re here to support you)
• *Recovery* – how you’ve been resting and recharging

These questions help us build a clear picture of your routine so we can tailor the next steps that actually matter for you.","{""to"": ""whatsapp:+447860362908"", ""twilio_sid"": ""SM42aa20b2466d8273e9ecb58df237a059""}",2026-02-23 10:35:48.546607
