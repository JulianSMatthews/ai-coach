# app/seed.py
# PATCH (2025-09-03)
# • Seeds pillars (incl. goals), 5 concepts/pillar (20 total).
# • Seeds per-concept primary + alternates (concept_questions).
# • Seeds 2 KB snippets per concept (kb_snippets).
# • Generates deterministic placeholder embeddings (kb_vectors).
# • Seeds demo users.
# • Adds seed_users() shim for legacy import.
